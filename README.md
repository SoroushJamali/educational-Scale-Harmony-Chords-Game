ChordSchool is a Processing desktop application allowing the user to challenge her/his memory about Melody Progression, Chord Progression and Scale Correction. According to the rules of scale harmony and melody progression. 

Our application is focused on the educational aspect of Scale harmony, therefore we are visually representing the user choices in key references, relative chords and modes as colors as well as notes over the keyboard, so to help him visualize the relevant music theory aside from hearing the result.
